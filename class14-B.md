## THE WORK ISSUE

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

* Its distinguished the good teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

* Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking is also good
for the team

* Most good teams have high average social sensitivity  a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

* The take for me from this topic is that when working in a team environment it needs communication
and expressing yourself and your emotions without the fear of judgement from your team members even
if it is a criticism, its how we deal with criticisms that makes a team a good one.

And everybody needs to talk their mind because being able to speak openly and freely to one another leads to more innovative ideas.
