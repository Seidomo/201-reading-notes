 # HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

 - The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
   brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
   made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
   has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
   something about the information that sits between its opening and
   closing tags.

## Attributes Tell Us More About Elements

- Attributes provide additional information
  about the contents of an element. They appear
  on the opening tag of the element and are
  made up of two parts: a name and a value,
  separated by an equals sign.

## Comments in HTML  
- If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be
  visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these
  characters:

     * <!-- -->

## Class Attribute

-  Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within
a document, you will want a way to identify several elements
as being different from the other elements on the page.
For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites. To do this you can use the
class attribute. Its value should describe the class it belongs to. 

## Getting your message across using design

- The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
